Weather App Journal using API

One-page HTML that takes user's input with ZIP code of the region (in this case regions of Spain) and 'feelings' (short description of user's day).
This data is later used to aquire temperature for the area via OpenWeather and add as a journal entry with current date.

Description of the functions is provided inside the app.js file.
